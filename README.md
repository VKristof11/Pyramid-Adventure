# Description 
This is my first attempt to make a game in Unity, there are still some bugs and endless improvements to be made.

The goal of the game is to find the bases at the end of the roads and capture them.
Along the way, you may encounter enemies who, when defeated, will give you coins that you can spend on upgrading your character.

## Features
- Random generated map
- Skill tree
- Save system (automatic saving when you capture a base)
- Enemy AIs
